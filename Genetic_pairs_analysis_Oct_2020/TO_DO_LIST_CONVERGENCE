DONE 1. fix directionality pairs PI
DONE 2. double check significant differences PI/GC 
DONE 3. check structural variants breseq2
DONE 4. remove 1 pair when multipe symetric mutation between 2 pairs -> likely indicate clonal origin/redoundance between pairs
DONE 4. make summary plots with all mutations per gene for all pairs and all phenotype (GC/PI/lethality)(as for grant) 
DONE 5. check convergence in PSM! (not annotated by snippy) 
DONE 6. check convergence intergenic sequence/promoter/sRNA
7. Repeat special annotation including TSS Emote 
8. Figure with operon maps
